# Markov Decision Processes {#sec-mdps}

{{< include macros.qmd >}}

## Introduction

**Machine learning** studies algorithms that learn to solve a task "on their own",
without needing a programmer to implement handwritten "if statements".
**Reinforcement learning (RL)** is a branch of machine learning that focuses on **decision problems** like the following:

#### Decision problems

![Board games and video games, such as a game of chess, where a player character takes actions that update the state of the game. [@guy_chess_2006]](shared/chess-pieces.jpg)

![Robotic control, where a robot can move and interact with the real world to complete some task. [@gpa_photo_archive_robotic_2017]](shared/robot-arm.jpg)
:::

All of these tasks involve taking a sequence of **actions**
in order to achieve some goal.
This **interaction loop** can be summarized in the following diagram:

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-rl-interaction
%%| fig-cap: The RL interaction loop. The agent chooses an **action** that affects the environment.
%%|          The environment updates according to the **state transitions**.
%%|          Then the agent observes the updated environment
%%|          and a **reward signal** that describes progress made towards the goal.
graph LR
    Agent --"takes *action*"--> Environment
    Environment --"observes *state*, *reward*"--> Agent
```

The strategy for choosing actions is called the *policy*.
The goal of an RL algorithm is to find a policy that maximizes the total reward.
This is a very general problem!
How can we describe such tasks using mathematics in a way that is *general* yet also *structured* enough for us to analyze?

This chapter will introduce the most popular formalization for such tasks:
**Markov decision processes (MDPs)**.
We will study **dynamic programming (DP)** algorithms
for solving *fully specified* tasks
in which we completely understand the environment.
We'll describe how to _evaluate_ different policies
and how to compute (or approximate)
the **optimal policy** for a given MDP.
We'll introduce the **Bellman consistency condition**, which allows us to analyze the whole sequence of interactions in terms of individual timesteps.

::: {#rem-complications}
#### Further generalizations

In the real world,
we often *don't* know how the environment works,
or it's too hard to represent the environment on a computer.
We will study such tasks in future chapters.
Additionally, in many tasks,
only a _subset_ of the state is visible to the observer.
We won't discuss such *partially observed* environments in this course.

## Finite-horizon Markov decision processes {#sec-finite-horizon-mdps}

To gain a better grasp of decision processes
and identify the key features that we want to formalize,
let us frame the _robotic control_ task in @exm-decision-problems
as a decision problem.

::: {#exm-mdp-robotics}
#### Robotic control as a decision problem

Suppose the goal is to move a robot to a certain position.

- The **state** consists of the positions and velocities of the robot's joints.
- The **action** consists of the forces to apply to the robot's motors.
- The **state transitions** are essentially the rules of physics:
  after applying a certain force to the joints,
  their positions and velocities would change according to physical law.
- We **reward** positions that are closer to the desired position.
  To be more energy-efficient,
  we could also deduct reward for applying a lot of force,
  or add other terms that describe the ideal behavior.
:::

::: {#exr-decision-problems}
#### Identifying decision problems

For each of the other examples in @exm-decision-problems,
what information should the _state_ include?
What might the valid set of _actions_ be?
Describe the _state transitions_ heuristically,
and a _reward function_ that describes how the task should be solved.
:::

In many decision problems,
the state transitions only depend on the *current* state and action.
For example, in @exm-mdp-robotics,
if we use Newton's laws of physics to compute the state transitions,
then just knowing the current positions and velocities is enough to calculate the next positions and velocities,
since Newton's laws are second-order.
We say that such state transitions satisfy the **Markov property**,
which we will formally define in @def-markov-property after introducing some notation.

::: {#exr-understanding-mdps}
#### Checking for the Markov property

Look back at the state transitions you described in @exr-decision-problems.
Do they satisfy the Markov property?
(For chess, consider the threefold repetition rule:
if the same position occurs three times during the game,
either player may claim a draw.)
:::

**Markov decision processes** (MDPs), which satisfy the Markov property,
are the most common formalization of decision problems.
MDPs can be classified as **finite-horizon**,
where the interactions end after some finite number of time steps,
or **infinite-horizon**, where the interactions are allowed to continue indefinitely.
We'll begin with the finite-horizon case and discuss the infinite-horizon case in @sec-infinite-horizon-mdps.


::: {#def-finite-horizon-mdp}

#### Finite-horizon Markov decision process

The components of a finite-horizon Markov decision process are:

1.  The **state** that the agent interacts with.
    We use $s_\hi$ to denote the state at time $\hi$.
    $\mathcal{S}$ denotes the set of possible states,
    called the **state space**.

2.  The **actions** that the agent can take.
    We use $a_\hi$ to denote the action at time $\hi$.
    $\mathcal{A}$ denotes set of possible actions,
    called the **action space**.

3.  An **initial state distribution** $d_0 \in \triangle(\mathcal{S})$.

4.  The **state transitions** (a.k.a. **dynamics**)
    $P : \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \to \triangle(\mathcal{S})$
    that describe what state the agent
    transitions to after taking an action.
    (We write $P(s_{\hi + 1} \mid s_\hi, a_\hi)$
    for the probability of transitioning to state $s_{\hi+1}$
    when starting in state $s_\hi$ and taking action $a_\hi$.)

5.  The **reward function**. In this course,
    we'll take it to be a deterministic function on state-action pairs,
    $r : \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{R}$,
    but many results will
    extend to a *stochastic* reward signal.
    We will use $r_{\hi} := r(s_\hi, a_\hi)$
    to denote the reward obtained
    at time $\hi$.

6.  A **time horizon** $\hor \in \mathbb{N}$
    that specifies the maximum number of interactions in a **trajectory**,
    that is, a single sequence of states, actions, and rewards:

$$
(s_0, a_0, r_0, \dots, s_{\hor-1}, a_{\hor-1}, r_{\hor-1}).
$$ {#eq-trajectory}

(Some sources omit the action and reward at the final time step.)

Combined together, these objects specify a finite-horizon Markov
decision process:

$$
\mathcal{M} = (\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, d_0, P, r, \hor).
$$
:::


When there are **finitely** many states and actions, i.e.
$|\mathcal{S}|, |\mathcal{A}| < \infty$, we can express
the relevant quantities as vectors and matrices (i.e. *tables* of
values):

$$
\begin{aligned}
    d_0 &\in [0, 1]^{|\mathcal{S}|} &
    P &\in [0, 1]^{(|\mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A}|) \times |\mathcal{S}|} &
    r &\in \mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{S}| \times |\mathcal{A}|}
\end{aligned}
$$

(Verify that the types and shapes provided above make sense!)

```{python}
class MDP(NamedTuple):
    """A description of a Markov decision process with finitely many states and actions."""
    S: int  # number of states
    A: int  # number of actions
    mu: Float[Array, " S"]
    P: Float[Array, "S A S"]  # "current" state, "current" action, "next" state
    r: Float[Array, "S A"]
    H: int  # the horizon
    gamma: float = 1.0  # discount factor (used later)

class Transition(NamedTuple):
    """A single state-action-reward interaction with the environment.

    A trajectory consists of a sequence of transitions.
    """
    s: int
    a: int
    r: float
```

::: {#def-markov-property}
#### Markov property

A decision process satisfies the **Markov property**
if the next state is independent
from the past states and actions
when conditioned on the current state and action:

$$
\pr(s_{\hi+1} \mid s_0, a_0, \dots, s_\hi, a_\hi) = \pr(s_{\hi+1} \mid s_\hi, a_\hi)
$$

By their definition,
Markov decision processes satisfy the Markov property.
This is because the state transitions are _defined_
using the function $P$,
which only takes in a single state-action pair to transition from.
:::

::: {#exm-tidy-mdp}
#### Tidying MDP

Let's consider a simple decision problem throughout this chapter:
the task of keeping your room tidy.

Your room has the possible states
$\mathcal{S} = \{ \text{orderly}, \text{messy} \}.$
You can take either of the actions $\mathcal{A} = \{ \text{ignore}, \text{tidy} \}.$
The room starts off orderly,
that is, $d_0(\text{orderly}) = 1$.

The **state transitions** are as follows:
if you tidy the room, it becomes (or remains) orderly;
if you ignore the room, it _might_ become messy,
according to the probabilities in @tbl-tidy.

The **rewards** are as follows: You get penalized for tidying an orderly room (a waste of time) or ignoring a messy room,
but you get rewarded for ignoring an orderly room (since you can enjoy your additional time).
Tidying a messy room is a chore that gives no reward.

Consider a time horizon of $\hor = 7$ days (one interaction per day). Let
$t = 0$ correspond to Monday and $t = 6$ correspond to Sunday.
:::

```{python}
#| label: tbl-tidy
#| tbl-cap: Description of the MDP in @exm-tidy-mdp.

tidy_mdp = MDP(
    S=2,  # 0 = orderly, 1 = messy
    A=2,  # 0 = ignore, 1 = tidy
    mu=jnp.array([1.0, 0.0]),  # start in orderly state
    P=jnp.array([
        [
            [0.7, 0.3],  # orderly, ignore
            [1.0, 0.0],  # orderly, tidy
        ],
        [
            [0.0, 1.0],  # messy, ignore
            [1.0, 0.0],  # messy, tidy
        ],
    ]),
    r=jnp.array([
        [
            1.0,   # orderly, ignore
            -1.0,  # orderly, tidy
        ],
        [
            -1.0,  # messy, ignore
            0.0,   # messy, tidy
        ]
    ]),
    H=7,
)

Markdown(tabulate(
    zip(*[
        ['orderly', 'orderly', 'messy', 'messy'],
        ['ignore', 'tidy', 'ignore', 'tidy'],
        tidy_mdp.P[:, :, 0].flatten(),
        tidy_mdp.P[:, :, 1].flatten(),
        tidy_mdp.r.flatten(),
    ]),
    [
        r"$s$",
        r"$a$",
        r"$P(\text{orderly} \mid s, a)$",
        r"$P(\text{messy} \mid s, a)$",
        r"$r(s, a)$",
    ]
))
```


We'll now introduce several core concepts when working with MDPs.

:::: {#def-policy}
#### Policies

A **policy** $\pi$ describes the agent's strategy:
which actions it takes in a given situation.
A key goal of RL is to find the **optimal policy** that maximizes the total reward on average.

There are three axes along which policies can vary:
their outputs, inputs, and time-dependence.

1.  Outputs: **Deterministic or stochastic.** A deterministic policy outputs
    actions while a stochastic policy outputs *distributions* over
    actions.

::: {#fig-deterministic-stochastic-policy layout-ncol=2}
![A deterministic policy, which produces a single action](shared/deterministic_policy.png)

![A stochastic policy, which produces a distribution over possible actions](shared/stochastic_policy.png)
:::

2.  Inputs: **history-independent or history-dependent.** A history-independent (a.k.a.
    "Markovian") policy only depends on the current state, while a
    history-dependent policy depends on the sequence of past states,
    actions, and rewards. We'll only consider history-independent policies
    in this course.

3.  **Stationary or time-dependent.**
    A stationary (a.k.a. time-homogeneous) policy
    keeps the same strategy at all time steps,
    while a time-dependent policy can depend on the current timestep.
    For consistency with states and actions,
    we will denote the timestep as a subscript,
    i.e. $\pi = \{ \pi_0, \dots, \pi_{\hor-1} \}.$
::::

Note that for finite state and action spaces,
we can represent a randomized mapping $\mathcal{S} \to \Delta(\mathcal{A})$
as a matrix $\pi \in [0, 1]^{\mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A}}$ where each row describes
the policy's distribution over actions for the corresponding state.

::: {#exm-tidy-policy}
#### Policies for the tidying MDP

Here are some possible deterministic policies for the tidying MDP @exm-tidy-mdp:

-   Always tidy: $\pi(s) = \text{tidy}$.
-   Only tidy on weekends: $\pi_\hi(s) = \text{tidy}$ if
    $\hi \in \{ 5, 6 \}$ and $\pi_\hi(s) = \text{ignore}$ otherwise.
-   Only tidy if the room is messy: $\pi_\hi(\text{messy}) = \text{tidy}$
    and $\pi_\hi(\text{orderly}) = \text{ignore}$ for all $\hi$.
:::

```{python}
# arrays of shape (H, S, A) represent time-dependent policies
tidy_policy_always_tidy = (
    jnp.zeros((7, 2, 2))
    .at[:, :, 1].set(1.0)
)
tidy_policy_weekends = (
    jnp.zeros((7, 2, 2))
    .at[5:7, :, 1].set(1.0)
    .at[0:5, :, 0].set(1.0)
)
tidy_policy_messy_only = (
    jnp.zeros((7, 2, 2))
    .at[:, 1, 1].set(1.0)
    .at[:, 0, 0].set(1.0)
)
```

<!-- ::: {#rem-jax-immutable}
Array objects in Jax are **immutable,** that is, they cannot be _changed._
This might seem inconvenient, but in larger projects,
immutability makes code easier to reason about.
::: -->


::: {#exr-markov-future}
#### Conditional independence for future states

Suppose actions are chosen according to a history-independent policy.
Use the chain rule of probability to show that,
conditioned on the current state and action $s_\hi, a_\hi$,
_all_ future states $s_{\hi'}$ where $\hi' > \hi$
are conditionally independent of the past states and actions.
That is, for all $\hi' > \hi$,

$$
\pr(s_{\hi'} \mid s_0, a_0, \dots, s_\hi, a_\hi) = \pr(s_{\hi'} \mid s_\hi, a_\hi).
$$
:::


::: {#def-trajectory-distribution}
#### Trajectory distribution

Once we've chosen a policy,
we can sample trajectories by repeatedly choosing actions according to the policy
and observing the rewards and updated states returned by the environment.
This generative process induces a distribution $\rho^{\pi}$ over trajectories.
(We assume that $d_0$ and $P$ are clear from context.)
:::

:::: {#exm-tidy-traj}
#### Trajectories in the tidying environment

Here is a possible trajectory for the tidying example:

::: {table}
|  $\hi$  |    $0$    |    $1$    |    $2$    |   $3$    |   $4$   |    $5$    |    $6$    |
| :-----: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :------: | :-----: | :-------: | :-------: |
|  $s$    |  orderly  |  orderly  |  orderly  |  messy   |  messy  |  orderly  |  orderly  |
|  $a$    |   tidy    |  ignore   |  ignore   |  ignore  |  tidy   |  ignore   |  ignore   |
|  $r$    |   $-1$    |    $1$    |    $1$    |   $-1$   |   $0$   |    $1$    |    $1$    |
:::

Could any of the policies in @exm-tidy-policy have generated this trajectory?
::::

Note that for a history-independent policy, using the Markov property (@def-markov-property),
we can write down the likelihood function of this probability distribution in an **autoregressive** way (i.e. one timestep at a time):

::: {#thm-autoregressive-trajectories}
#### Trajectory distributions of history-independent policies

Let $\pi$ be a history-independent policy.
Then its trajectory distribution $\rho^\pi$ (@def-trajectory-distribution)
can be written as

$$
\rho^{\pi}(\tau) := d_0(s_0) \pi_0(a_0 \mid s_0) P(s_1 \mid s_0, a_0) \cdots P(s_{\hor-1} \mid s_{\hor-2}, a_{\hor-2}) \pi_{\hor-1}(a_{\hor-1} \mid s_{\hor-1})

::: {#exr-stochastic-reward-trajectory-likelihood}
#### Trajectory distribution for stochastic reward

Modify @eq-autoregressive-trajectories for the case when the reward function is stochastic,
that is, $r : \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \to \triangle(\R)$.
:::

For a deterministic policy $\pi$,
we have that $\pi_\hi(a \mid s) = \ind{a = \pi_\hi(s)}$;
that is, the probability of taking an action is $1$ if it's the unique action prescribed by the policy for that state and $0$ otherwise.
In this case, the only randomness in sampling trajectories comes from the initial state distribution $d_0$ and the state transitions $P$.

### Policy evaluation {#sec-eval-dp-finite-horizon}

Recall that the core goal of an RL algorithm
is to find a policy that maximizes the expected total reward

$$
\E [r_0 + \cdots + r_{\hor-1}],
$$ {#eq-expected-total-reward}

where $r_\hi = r(s_\hi, a_\hi)$.
Note that the quantity $r_0 + \cdots + r_{\hor-1}$ is a random variable
whose distribution depends on the policy's trajectory distribution $\rho^\pi$ (@def-trajectory-distribution).
We need tools for describing the expected total reward achieved by a given policy,
starting in specific states and actions.
This will allow us to compare the quality of different policies
and compute the optimal policy.

::: {#def-value}
#### Value function

Let $\pi$ be a history-independent policy.
Its **value function** at time $\hi$ returns the expected remaining reward
when starting in a specific state:

$$
V_\hi^\pi(s) := \E_{\tau \sim \rho^\pi} [r_\hi + \cdots + r_{H-1} \mid s_\hi = s]
$$ {#eq-v}

Similarly,
a history-independent policy's **action-value function** (aka Q function)
at time $\hi$ returns its expected remaining reward,
starting in a specific state
_and_ taking a specific action:

$$
Q_\hi^\pi(s, a) := \E_{\tau \sim \rho^\pi} [r_\hi + \cdots + r_{H-1} \mid s_\hi = s, a_\hi = a].

Putting @eq-relating-v-q and @eq-relating-q-v together
reveals the _Bellman consistency equations_.
By simply considering the cumulative reward
as the sum of the *immediate* reward and the *remaining* reward,
we can describe the
value function in terms of itself.
The resulting system of equations
is named after **Richard Bellman** (1920--1984),
who is credited with introducing dynamic programming in 1953.

::: {#thm-consistency}
#### Bellman consistency equations

For a history-independent policy $\pi$,

$$
V_\hi^\pi(s) = \E_{\substack{a \sim \pi_\hi(s) \\ s' \sim P(s, a)}} [r(s, a) + V_{\hi+1}^\pi(s')].
$$ {#eq-consistency}

The proof is left as @exr-proof-consistency.
This is a system of $H |\mathcal{S}|$ equations
(one equation per state per timestep)
in $H |\mathcal{S}|$ unknowns
(the values $V_\hi^\pi(s)$),
so $V^\pi$ is the unique solution,
as long as no two states are exactly identical to each other.

::: {#rem-bellman-for-deterministic}
#### The Bellman consistency equation for deterministic policies

Note that for history-independent deterministic policies,
the Bellman consistency equations simplify to

$$
V_\hi^\pi(s) = r(s, \pi_\hi(s)) + \E_{s' \sim P(s, \pi_\hi(s))} [V_{\hi+1}^\pi(s')].
$$ {#eq-bellman-deterministic}
:::

How can we actually _evaluate_ a given policy,
that is, compute its value function?

Suppose we start with some guess $v_\hi : \mathcal{S} \to \R$
for the state values at time $\hi = 0, \dots, \hor-1$.
We write $v$ in lowercase to indicate
that it might not be an actual value function of a policy.
How might we improve this guess?

Recall that the Bellman consistency equations (@eq-consistency)
hold for the value functions of history-independent policies.
So if $v$ is close to the target $V^\pi$,
it should nearly satisfy the system of equations
associated with $\pi$.
With this in mind,
suppose we replace $V^\pi_{\hi+1}$ with $v_{\hi+1}$ on the right-hand side.
Then the new right-hand side quantity,

$$
\E_{\substack{a \sim \pi_\hi(s) \\ s' \sim P(s, a)}} [r(s, a) + v_{\hi+1}(s')],
$$ {#eq-updated-bellman}

can be thought of as follows:
we take one action according to $\pi$,
observe the immediate reward,
and evaluate the next state using $v$.
This is illustrated in @fig-updated-bellman below.
This operation gives us an _updated_ estimate of the value of $V^\pi_\hi(s)$
that is at least as accurate as applying $v(s)$ directly.

We can treat this operation
of taking $v_\hi$ to its improved version in @eq-updated-bellman
as a _higher-order function_
known as the Bellman operator.

::: {#def-bellman-operator}
#### Bellman operator

Let $\pi : \mathcal{S} \to \triangle(\mathcal{A})$.
the Bellman operator $\mathcal{J}^{\pi} : (\mathcal{S} \to \R) \to (\mathcal{S} \to \R)$
is the higher-order function 
that takes in a function $v : \mathcal{S} \to \R$
and returns the r.h.s. of the Bellman equation with $v$ substituted in:

$$
\mathcal{J}^{\pi}(v) := \left(
    s \mapsto \E_{\substack{a \sim \pi(s) \\ s' \sim P(s, a)}} [r(s, a) + v(s')]
\right).
$$ {#eq-bellman-operator}
:::

The Bellman operator is a crucial tool for reasoning about MDPs.
Intuitively, it answers the following question:
if we evaluate the _next_ state using $v$,
how good is the _current_ state,
if we take a single action from the given policy?

```{python}

    trim_prefixes={"mdp"},
    subscript_type="call",
)
```

The Bellman operator also gives us a concise way to express the Bellman consistency equations (@eq-consistency) for the value function:

$$
V_\hi^\pi = \mathcal{J}^{\pi_\hi}(V_{\hi+1}^\pi)
$$ {#eq-bellman-operator-consistency}

The Bellman consistency equations (@eq-consistency)
give us a convenient algorithm for evaluating stationary policies:
it expresses the value function at timestep $\hi$
as a function of the value function at timestep $\hi+1$.
This means we can start at the end of the time horizon,
where the value is known,
and work backwards in time,
using the Bellman operator
to compute the value function at each time step.

```{python}
#| label: fig-dp-eval-finite
#| fig-cap: A dynamic programming algorithm for evaluating a policy in a finite-horizon MDP.

def dp_eval_finite(mdp: MDP, policy: Float[Array, "S A"]) -> Float[Array, "H S"]:
    """Evaluate a policy using dynamic programming."""
    V = np.zeros((mdp.H + 1, mdp.S))  # initialize to 0 at end of time horizon
    for h in range(mdp.H - 1, -1, -1):
        V[h] = bellman_operator(mdp, policy[h], V[h + 1])
    return V[:-1]

latex(
    dp_eval_finite,
    id_to_latex={"bellman_operator": r"\mathcal{J}", "policy": r"\pi", "V": "V^\pi"},
)
```

This runs in time $O(H \cdot |\mathcal{S}|^2 \cdot |\mathcal{A}|)$.
Note that the implementation of the Bellman operator in @fig-bellman-pseudocode
can be easily modified to compute $Q^\pi$ as an intermediate step. Do you see how?

### Optimality {#sec-finite-opt-dp}

We've just seen how to *evaluate* a given policy.
But how can we find the _best_ policy for a given environment?
We must first define what it means for a policy to be optimal.
We'll investigate optimality for _history-independent_ policies.
In @thm-optimal-greedy,
we'll see that constraining ourselves to history-independent policies
isn't actually a constraint:
the best history-independent policy performs
at least as well as
the best history-dependent policy,
in all scenarios!

::: {#rem-optimal-intuition}
#### Intuition

How is this possible?
Recall the Markov property (@def-markov-property),
which says that once we know the current state,
the next state becomes independent from the past history.
This means that history-dependent policies, intuitively speaking,
don't benefit over simply history-independent ones in MDPs.
:::

::: {#def-optimal-policy-finite}
#### Optimal policies

Let $\pi^\star$ be a history-independent policy.
We say that $\pi^\star$ is **optimal**
if $V_\hi^{\pi^\star}(s) \ge V_\hi^{\pi}(s)$
for any history-independent policy $\pi$ at any time $\hi \in [\hor]$.
In other words,
an optimal history-independent policy achieves the highest possible
expected remaining reward in every state at every time.
:::

::: {#exm-optimal-tidy}
#### Optimal policy in the tidying MDP

For the tidying MDP (@exm-tidy-mdp),
you might guess that the optimal strategy is

$$
\pi(s) = \begin{cases}
\text{tidy} & s = \text{messy} \\
\text{ignore} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$ {#eq-tidy-optimal}

since this keeps the room in the "orderly" state
in which reward can be obtained.
:::

::: {#def-optimal-value}
#### Optimal value function

Given a state $s$ at time $\hi$,
the optimal value $V^\star_\hi(s)$
is the _maximum_ expected remaining reward
achievable by any history-independent policy $\pi$:

$$
V^\star_\hi(s) := \max_{\pi} V^{\pi}_\hi(s).
$$ {#eq-optimal-value}

The optimal action-value function is defined analogously:

$$
Q^\star_\hi(s, a) := \max_{\pi} Q^{\pi}_\hi(s, a).
$$ {#eq-optimal-action-value}
:::

These satisfy the following relationship (cf @thm-relating-v-q):

::: {#thm-relating-optimal-v-q}
#### Relating $V^\star$ and $Q^\star$

The optimal value of a state
is the maximum value across actions from that state:

$$
V_\hi^\star(s) = \max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} Q^\star_\hi(s, a).
$$ {#eq-optimal-v-q}

The optimal value of an action
is the immediate reward
plus the expected value from the next state:

$$
Q^\star_\hi(s, a) = r(s, a) + \E_{s' \sim P(s, a)} [V^\star_{\hi+1}(s')].
$$ {#eq-optimal-q-v}
:::

::: {.proof}
We first prove @eq-optimal-v-q.
We begin by expanding the definition of the optimal value function
using @eq-relating-v-q:

$$
\begin{aligned}
V_\hi^\star(s)
&= \max_\pi V^\pi_\hi(s) \\
&= \max_\pi \E_{a \sim \pi_\hi(s)} [
    Q^\pi_\hi(s, a)
].
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-step-v-q}

Now note that $Q^\pi_\hi$ doesn't depend on $\pi_\hi$,
so we can split the maximization over $\pi = (\pi_0, \dots, \pi_{\hor-1})$
into an _outer_ optimization over the immediate action $\pi_\hi$
and an _inner_ optimization over the remaining actions
$\pi_{\hi + 1}, \dots, \pi_{\hor-1}$:

$$
\max_\pi \E_{a \sim \pi_\hi(s)} \Big[
    Q^\pi_\hi(s, a)
]
= \max_{\pi_\hi} \E_{a \sim \pi_\hi(s)} \Big[
    \max_{\pi_{\hi+1}, \dots, \pi_{\hor-1}}
    Q^\pi_\hi(s, a)
\Big].
$$ {#eq-step-split-optimization}

But now the inner quantity is exactly $Q^\star_\hi(s, a)$
as defined in @eq-optimal-action-value.
Now note that maximizing over $\pi_\hi$
reduces to just maximizing over the action taken:

$$
\max_{\pi_\hi} \E_{a \sim \pi_\hi(s)} [\cdots] = \max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} [\cdots].
$$ {#eq-max-mean}

This proves @eq-optimal-v-q.

We now prove @eq-optimal-q-v.
We begin by using @eq-relating-q-v:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Q^\star_\hi(s, a) &= \max_\pi Q^\pi_\hi(s, a) \\
&= \max_\pi \Big[ r(s, a) + \E_{s' \sim P(s, a)}[ V^\pi_{\hi+1}(s') ] \Big]
\end{aligned}
$$

We can move the maximization over $\pi$ under the expectation
since $s, a$, and $s'$ are all independent of $\pi$.
Substituting the definition of $V^\star$ concludes the proof.
:::

As in the Bellman consistency equations (@thm-consistency),
combining @eq-optimal-v-q and @eq-optimal-q-v gives the _Bellman optimality equations_.

::: {#thm-bellman-opt}
#### Bellman optimality equations

The optimal value function function (@def-optimal-value) satisfies,
for all timesteps $\hi \in [\hor-1]$,

$$
V_\hi^\star(s) = \max_a r(s, a) + \E_{s' \sim P(s, a)} [V_{\hi+1}^\star(s')].
$$ {#eq-bellman-opt}

Like the Bellman consistency equations (@eq-consistency),
This is a system of $H |\mathcal{S}|$ equations
in $H |\mathcal{S}|$ unknowns,
so $V^\star$ is the unique solution
(assuming all the states are distinguishable from each other).

Note that the letter $\pi$ doesn't appear.
This will prove useful when we discuss **off-policy algorithms**
later in the course.
:::

We now construct a deterministic history-independent optimal policy
by acting *greedily*
with respect to the optimal action-value function:

::: {#def-greedy-policy}
#### Greedy policies

For any sequence of functions
$q_h : \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \to \R$ for $h = 0, \dots, H-1$,
we define the **greedy policy** $\pi^q$
to be the deterministic policy that selects the action
with the highest value according to $q$ at each state:

$$
\pi_h^q(s) := \arg\max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} q_h(s, a).
$$ {#eq-def-greedy}

Note that it is _not_ true in general that $Q^{\pi^q} = q$
for a greedy policy!
For one,
$q$ might not even be a consistent Q function.
:::

```{python}
def q_to_greedy(q: Float[Array, "S A"]) -> Float[Array, "S A"]:

    a_ary = jnp.argmax(q, axis=1)
    return jnp.eye(A)[a_ary]


def v_to_greedy(mdp: MDP, v: Float[Array, " S"]) -> Float[Array, "S A"]:
    """Get the (deterministic) greedy policy with respect to a value function."""
    return q_to_greedy(v_to_q(mdp, v))
```

::: {#thm-optimal-greedy}
#### A greedy optimal policy

The greedy policy $\pi^{Q^\star}$, where $Q^\star$ is the optimal action-value function (@eq-optimal-action-value),
is an optimal policy (@def-optimal-policy-finite).
Furthermore,
$\pi^{Q^\star}$ is optimal across _all_ policies $\pi^\text{any}$,
including history-dependent ones,
in the sense that for any partial trajectory

$$
\tau_\hi = (s_0, a_0, r_0, \dots, s_{\hi-1}, a_{\hi-1}, r_{\hi-1}, s_\hi),
$$

it achieves a higher expected remaining reward:

$$
\E_{\tau \sim \rho^{\pi^{Q^\star}}} [
    r_\hi + \cdots + r_{\hor-1}
    \mid \tau_\hi
]
\ge
\E_{\tau \sim \rho^{\pi^\text{any}}} [
    r_\hi + \cdots + r_{\hor-1}
    \mid \tau_\hi
].
$$ {#eq-optimal-all}

By conditioning on $\tau_\hi$,
we mean to condition on the event that
$s_{\hi'}, a_{\hi'}$ are the state and action
visited at time $\hi' < \hi$,
and $s_\hi$ is the state at time $\hi$.
(If the reward function were stochastic,
we would condition on the observed rewards as well.)
:::

We will now prove by induction that $\pi^{Q^\star}$ is optimal.
(See @sec-induction if you're unfamiliar with inductive proofs.)
Essentially,
we begin at the _end_ of the trajectory,
where the optimal action is simply the one that yields highest immediate reward.
Once the optimal values at time $\hor-1$ are known,
we use these to compute the optimal values at time $\hor-2$ using the Bellman optimality equations (@eq-bellman-opt),
and proceed backward through the trajectory.

```

::: {.proof}
At the end of the trajectory (time step $H-1$),
we can't take any more actions,
so the $Q$-function simply returns the immediate reward:

$$
Q^\star_{\hor-1}(s, a) = r(s, a).
$$ {#eq-q-star-end}

$\pi^{Q^\star}$ is then optimal across _all_ policies at time $\hor-1$,
since the policy only determines a single action,
the one which maximizes (expected) remaining reward:

$$
\E_{\tau \sim \rho^{\pi^{Q^\star}}}[ r_{\hor-1} \mid s_{\hor - 1} = s ]
= \max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} r(s, a).
$$ {#eq-end-optimal}

For the inductive step,
suppose $\pi^{Q^\star}$ is optimal across _all_ policies
at time $\hi+1$.
Note that this implies $V^{\pi^{Q^\star}} = V^\star$.
Then for any other policy $\pi^\text{any}$
(which could be history-dependent),
and for any partial trajectory $\tau_{\hi}$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
&{} \E_{\tau \sim \rho^{\pi^\text{any}}} [
    r_\hi + \cdots + r_{\hor-1} \mid \tau_{\hi}
] \\
={}&
\E_{\substack{a \sim \pi^\text{any}_\hi(\tau_\hi) \\ s' \sim P(s_\hi, a)}} \left[

        r_{\hi+1} + \cdots + r_{\hor-1}
        \mid
        \tau_{\hi},
        a_\hi = a,
        s_{\hi+1} = s'
    ]
\right] \\
\le{}&
\E_{\substack{a \sim \pi^\text{any}_\hi(\tau_\hi) \\ s' \sim P(s_\hi, a)}} \left[
    r_\hi + V^\star_{\hi+1}(s')
\right] \\

\max_{a \in \mathcal{A}}
r(s_\hi, a)

\E_{s' \sim P(s_\hi, a)} \left[
    V^\star_{\hi+1}(s')
\right] \\
={}& V^\star_\hi(s_\hi).
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-pi-star-proof}

This completes the inductive step,
which shows that $\pi^{Q^\star}$ is optimal across _all_ policies
at every time $\hi \in [\hor]$.

At each of the $H$ timesteps, we must compute $Q^{\star}_\hi$
for each of the $|\mathcal{S}| |\mathcal{A}|$ state-action pairs.
Each computation takes $|\mathcal{S}|$ operations to evaluate the average value over $s'$.
Computing $\pi^\star_\hi$ and $V^\star_\hi$
then requires computing the value-maximizing action in each state,
which is an additional $O(|\mathcal{S}| \mathcal{A}|)$ comparisons.
This is dominated by the earlier term,
resulting in a total computation time of
$O(H \cdot |\mathcal{S}|^2 \cdot |\mathcal{A}|)$.

Note that this algorithm is identical to the policy evaluation algorithm (@fig-dp-eval-finite),
but instead of *averaging* over the actions chosen by a policy,
we instead take a *maximum* over the action-values.
We'll see this relationship
between **policy evaluation** and **optimal policy computation**
show up again in the infinite-horizon setting.

Let us review some equivalent definitions of an optimal policy:

::: {#rem-equivalent-optimal}
#### Equivalent definitions of an optimal policy

Let $\pi$ be a stationary policy.
Then the following are all equivalent:

1. $\pi$ is optimal across history-independent policies (@def-optimal-policy-finite).
2. $\pi$ is optimal across all policies (@eq-optimal-all).
3. $V^\pi = V^\star$.
4. $Q^\pi = Q^\star$.
5. $V^\pi$ satisfies the Bellman optimality equations (@eq-bellman-opt).

1 and 3 are the same by definition.
3 and 4 are the same since $V^\star$ and $Q^\star$
uniquely define each other by @eq-optimal-v-q
and $V^\pi$ and $Q^\pi$ uniquely define each other by @eq-relating-v-q and @eq-relating-q-v.
3 and 5 are the same by the Bellman optimality equations (@thm-bellman-opt).
1 and 2 are the same as shown in the proof of @thm-optimal-greedy.
:::

::: {#rem-why-stochastic}
#### Why stochastic policies

Given that there exists an optimal deterministic policy,
why do we try ever try to learn stochastic policies?
We will see a partial answer to this when we discuss
the _exploration-exploitation_ tradeoff in @sec-bandits.
So far, we've assumed that the environment is totally known.
If it isn't, however,
we need some way to explore different possible actions,
and stochastic policies provide a natural way to do this.
:::

## Infinite-horizon Markov decision processes {#sec-infinite-horizon-mdps}

What if we allow trajectories to continue for an infinite amount of time,
that is, set the time horizon $H$ to infinity?
This might seem impractical,
since in the real world,
most of the trajectories we care about terminate after some fixed number of steps.
However, we will see that **infinite-horizon** MDPs are simpler in certain regards
and can serve as good approximations to finite-horizon tasks.
A crucial result is that Bellman operators (@def-bellman-operator)
in this setting are **contraction mappings** (@thm-bellman-contraction),
which yield simple fixed-point iteration algorithms for policy evaluation (@sec-iterative-pe)
and computing the optimal value function (@sec-vi).
Finally, we'll present the policy iteration algorithm (@sec-pi).
In addition to being an effective tool in its own right,
we will find that policy iteration serves as a useful _framework_
for designing and analyzing later algorithms.

### Differences from the finite horizon setting

::: {#rem-discount}
#### Discounted rewards

First of all,
note that the total reward
$r_0 + r_{1} + \cdots$
might blow up to infinity.
To ensure that we work with bounded quantities,
we insert a
**discount factor** $\gamma \in [0, 1)$
such that rewards become less
valuable the further into the future they are:

$$
r_0 + \gamma r_{1} + \gamma^2 r_{2} + \cdots
=
\sum_{\hi=0}^\infty \gamma^\hi r_{\hi}
\le R \frac{1}{1 - \gamma},
$$ {#eq-discounted-rewards}

where $R$ is the maximum possible reward.
We can think of $\gamma$ as measuring how much we care about the future:
if it's close to $0$, we only care about the near-term rewards;
if it's close to $1$, we put more weight into future rewards.

You can also analyze $\gamma$
as the *probability of continuing* the trajectory at each time step.
(This is equivalent to $H$ being distributed by a First Success distribution
with success probability $\gamma$.)
This accords with the above interpretation:
if $\gamma$ is close to $0$,
the trajectory will likely be very short,
while if $\gamma$ is close to $1$,
the trajectory will likely continue for a long time.
:::

The other components of the MDP remain from the finite-horizon setting (@def-finite-horizon-mdp):

$$
\mathcal{M} = (\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, d_0, P, r, \gamma).
$$

```{python}
# Code-wise, we can reuse the `MDP` class from before @def-finite-horizon-mdp and set `mdp.H = float('inf')`.

tidy_mdp_inf = tidy_mdp._replace(H=float("inf"), gamma=0.95)
```

::: {#rem-stationary-policies}
#### Stationary policies

Time-dependent policies become difficult to handle in the infinite-horizon case.
Not only would they be computationally impossible to store,
but also,
many of the DP approaches we saw
required us to start at the end of the trajectory,
which is no longer possible.
We'll shift to **stationary** policies
$\pi : \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{A}$ (deterministic)
or $\triangle(\mathcal{A})$ (stochastic),
which don't explicitly depend on the timestep.
:::

::: {#exr-tidy-stationary}
#### Stationary policy examples

Which of the policies in @exm-tidy-policy (policies in the tidying MDP) are stationary?
:::

::: {#def-value-infinite}
#### Value functions

We'll also consider stationary value functions
$V^\pi : \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}$ and
$Q^\pi : \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{R}$.
These now represent the expected total _discounted_ reward:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    V^\pi(s) &= \E_{\tau \sim \rho^\pi} [r_0 + \gamma r_{1} + \gamma^2 r_{2} + \cdots \mid s_0 = s] \\
    Q^\pi(s, a) &= \E_{\tau \sim \rho^\pi} [r_0 + \gamma r_{1} + \gamma^2 r_{2} + \cdots \mid s_0 = s, a_0 = a] \\
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-consistency-infinite}
:::

::: {#exr-infinite-no-time-step}
#### Time-independent

Note that we add up the rewards starting from time $0$,
whereas in the finite-horizon case,
we needed to explicitly add the rewards from time $\hi$ onwards.
Heuristically speaking,
why does it no longer matter which time step we start on
when defining the value function?
Refer back to the Markov property (@def-markov-property).
:::

::: {#thm-infinite-consistency}
#### Bellman consistency equations

The Bellman consistency equations play the same role
they did in the finite-horizon setting
(@thm-consistency).
We need to insert a factor of $\gamma$
to account for the discounting,
and the $\hi$ subscript is gone since $V^\pi$ is stationary:

$$
V^\pi(s) = \E_{\substack{a \sim \pi(s) \\ s' \sim P(s, a)}} [r(s, a) + \gamma V^\pi(s')].
$$ {#eq-infinite-consistency}

The value function and action-value function are still related in the same way:

$$
\begin{aligned}
V^\pi(s) &= \E_{a \sim \pi(s)} [Q(s, a)] \\
Q^\pi(s, a) &= r(s, a) + \gamma \E_{s' \sim P(s, a)} [V^\pi(s')].
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-infinite-v-and-q}
:::

### Contraction mappings

Recall that a policy's _Bellman operator_
takes a guess for the policy's value function
and returns an _improved_ guess using one step of the policy
(@def-bellman-operator).
In the infinite-horizon setting, this has the same form:

::: {#def-infinite-bellman}
#### Bellman operator

Let $\pi : \mathcal{S} \to \triangle(\mathcal{A})$
be a stationary policy.
Its **Bellman operator** is defined

$$
\mathcal{J}^{\pi}(v) := \Big(
    s \mapsto \E_{\substack{a \sim \pi(s) \\ s' \sim P(s, a)}} [r(s, a) + \gamma v(s')]
\Big).
$$ {#eq-infinite-bellman-operator}
:::

The crucial property of the Bellman operator
is that it is a **contraction mapping** for any policy.
Intuitively, if we start with
two guesses $v, u : \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}$,
if we repeatedly apply the Bellman operator to each of them,
they will get closer and closer together
at an exponential rate.

::: {#def-contraction}
#### Contraction mapping

Let $X$ be a set with a norm $\|\cdot\|$.
We call an operator $f: X \to X$
a **contraction mapping**
if for any $x, y \in X$,

$$
\|f(x) - f(y)\| \le \gamma \|x - y\|
$$

for some fixed $\gamma \in (0, 1)$.
:::

::: {#exr-contraction-shrinks}
#### Contraction mappings pull points together

Show that for a contraction mapping $f$ with coefficient $\gamma$,
for all $t \in \mathbb{N}$,

$$
\|f^{(t)}(x) - f^{(t)}(y)\| \le \gamma^t \|x - y\|,
$$ {#eq-contraction-shrinks}

i.e. any two points will be pushed closer
by at least a factor of $\gamma$
at each iteration.
:::

It is a powerful fact,
known as the **Banach fixed-point theorem**,
that every contraction mapping has a unique **fixed point** $x^\star$
such that $f(x^\star) = x^\star$.
This means that if we repeatedly apply $f$ to any starting point,
we will eventually converge to $x^\star$:

$$
\|f^{(t)}(x) - x^\star\| \le \gamma^t \|x - x^\star\|.
$$ {#eq-contraction-convergence}

Let's return to the RL setting
and apply this result to the Bellman operator.
How can we measure the distance between two functions
$v, u : \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}$?
We'll take the **supremum norm** as our distance metric:

$$
\| v - u \|_{\infty} := \sup_{s \in \mathcal{S}} |v(s) - u(s)|,
$$

i.e. we compare the functions
on the state that causes the biggest gap between them.
The Bellman consistency equations (@thm-infinite-consistency)
state that $V^\pi$ is the fixed point of $\mathcal{J}^\pi$.
Then @eq-contraction-convergence implies that
if we repeatedly apply $\mathcal{J}^\pi$ to any starting guess,
we will eventually converge to $V^\pi$:

$$
\|(\mathcal{J}^\pi)^{(t)}(v) - V^\pi \|_{\infty} \le \gamma^{t} \| v - V^\pi\|_{\infty}.
$$ {#eq-bellman-convergence}

We'll use this useful fact to prove the convergence of several
algorithms later on.

::: {#thm-bellman-contraction}
#### The Bellman operator is a contraction mapping

Let $\pi$ be a stationary policy.
There exists $\gamma \in (0, 1)$ such that
for any two functions $u, v : \mathcal{S} \to \R$,

$$
\|\mathcal{J}^{\pi} (v) - \mathcal{J}^{\pi} (u) \|_{\infty} \le \gamma \|v - u \|_{\infty}.
$$
:::

::: {.proof}

For all states $s \in \mathcal{S}$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
|[\mathcal{J}^{\pi} (v)](s) - [\mathcal{J}^{\pi} (u)](s)|&= \Big| \mathop{\mathbb{E}}_{a \sim \pi(s)} \left[ r(s, a) + \gamma \mathop{\mathbb{E}}_{s' \sim P(s, a)} v(s') \right] \\
&\qquad - \mathop{\mathbb{E}}_{a \sim \pi(s)} \left[r(s, a) + \gamma \mathop{\mathbb{E}}_{s' \sim P(s, a)} u(s') \right] \Big| \\
&= \gamma \left|\mathop{\mathbb{E}}_{s' \sim P(s, a)} [v(s') - u(s')] \right| \\
&\le \gamma \mathop{\mathbb{E}}_{s' \sim P(s, a)}|v(s') - u(s')| \qquad \text{(Jensen's inequality)} \\
&\le \gamma \max_{s'} |v(s') - u(s')| \\
&= \gamma \|v - u \|_{\infty}.
\end{aligned}
$$
:::

### Policy evaluation {#sec-infinite-policy-evaluation}

The backwards DP technique we used in the finite-horizon case (@sec-eval-dp-finite-horizon)
no longer works
since there is no "final timestep" to start from.
We'll need another approach to policy evaluation.

The Bellman consistency equations (@thm-infinite-consistency)
yield a system of $|\mathcal{S}|$ equations we can solve
to evaluate a deterministic policy *exactly*.
For a faster approximate solution,
we can iterate the policy's Bellman operator,
since we know that it has a unique fixed point
at the true value function.

#### Matrix inversion for deterministic policies

Note that when the policy $\pi$ is deterministic,
the actions can be determined from the states,
and so we can chop off the action dimension
for the rewards and state transitions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    r^{\pi} &\in \mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{S}|} & P^{\pi} &\in [0, 1]^{|\mathcal{S}| \times |\mathcal{S}|} & d_0 &\in [0, 1]^{|\mathcal{S}|} \\
    \pi &\in \mathcal{A}^{|\mathcal{S}|} & V^\pi &\in \mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{S}|} & Q^\pi &\in \mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{S}| \times |\mathcal{A}|}.
\end{aligned}
$$

For $P^\pi$, we'll treat the rows as the states
and the columns as the next states.
Then $P^\pi_{s, s'}$ is the probability of transitioning
from state $s$ to state $s'$ under policy $\pi$.

::: {#exm-tidy-tabular-evaluation}
#### Tidying MDP

The tabular MDP from @exm-tidy-mdp
has $|\mathcal{S}| = 2$ and $|\mathcal{A}| = 2$.
Let's write down the quantities
for the policy $\pi$ that tidies if and only if the room is messy:

$$
r^{\pi} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},
\quad
P^{\pi} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.7 & 0.3 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix},
\quad
d_0 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
$$
        
We'll see how to
evaluate this policy in the next section.
:::

The Bellman consistency equation for a deterministic policy can be
written in tabular notation as

$$
V^\pi = r^\pi + \gamma P^\pi V^\pi.
$$

(Unfortunately, this notation doesn't simplify the expression for
$Q^\pi$.) This system of equations can be solved with a matrix
inversion:

$$
V^\pi = (I - \gamma P^\pi)^{-1} r^\pi.
$$ {#eq-matrix-inversion-pe}

::: {#exr-invertible-dynamics}
#### Matrix invertibility

Note we've assumed that $I - \gamma P^\pi$ is invertible.
Can you see why this is the case?
(Recall that a linear operator, i.e. a square matrix,
is invertible if and only if its null space is trivial;
that is, it doesn't map any nonzero vector to zero.
Show that $I - \gamma P^\pi$ maps any nonzero vector
to another nonzero vector.)
:::

```{python}
def eval_deterministic_infinite(
    mdp: MDP, policy: Float[Array, "S A"]
) -> Float[Array, " S"]:
    pi = jnp.argmax(policy, axis=1)  # un-one-hot
    P_pi = mdp.P[jnp.arange(mdp.S), pi]
    r_pi = mdp.r[jnp.arange(mdp.S), pi]
    return jnp.linalg.solve(jnp.eye(mdp.S) - mdp.gamma * P_pi, r_pi)
```

::: {#exm-tidy-eval-infinite}
#### Tidying policy evaluation

Let's use the same policy $\pi$ that tidies if and only if the room is
messy. Setting $\gamma = 0.95$, we must invert

$$
I - \gamma P^{\pi} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 - 0.95 \times 0.7 & - 0.95 \times 0.3 \\ - 0.95 \times 1 & 1 - 0.95 \times 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.335 & -0.285 \\ -0.95 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

The inverse to two decimal points is

$$
(I - \gamma P^{\pi})^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} 15.56 & 4.44 \\ 14.79 & 5.21 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

Thus the value function is

$$
V^{\pi} = (I - \gamma P^{\pi})^{-1} r^{\pi} = \begin{bmatrix} 15.56 & 4.44 \\ 14.79 & 5.21 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 15.56 \\ 14.79 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

Let's sanity-check this result.
Since rewards are at most $1$, the
maximum cumulative return of a trajectory is at most
$1/(1-\gamma) = 20$.
We see that the value function is indeed slightly lower than this.
:::

```{python}
eval_deterministic_infinite(tidy_mdp_inf, tidy_policy_messy_only[0])
```

#### Iterative policy evaluation {#sec-iterative-pe}

The matrix inversion above takes roughly $O(|\mathcal{S}|^3)$ time.
It also only works for deterministic policies.
Can we trade off the requirement of finding the *exact* value function for a faster
*approximate* algorithm that will also extend to stochastic policies?

Let's use the Bellman operator to define an iterative algorithm for
computing the value function. We'll start with an initial guess
$v^{(0)}$ with elements in $[0, 1/(1-\gamma)]$ and then iterate the
Bellman operator:

$$
v^{(t+1)} = \mathcal{J}^{\pi}(v^{(t)}),
$$

i.e. $v^{(t)} = (\mathcal{J}^{\pi})^{(t)} (v^{(0)})$. Note that each iteration
takes $O(|\mathcal{S}|^2)$ time for the matrix-vector multiplication.

```{python}
def supremum_norm(v):
    return jnp.max(jnp.abs(v))  # same as jnp.linalg.norm(v, jnp.inf)


def loop_until_convergence(op, v, ε=1e-6):
    """Repeatedly apply op to v until convergence (in supremum norm)."""
    while True:
        v_new = op(v)
        if supremum_norm(v_new - v) < ε:
            return v_new
        v = v_new


def iterative_evaluation(mdp: MDP, pi: Float[Array, "S A"], ε=1e-6) -> Float[Array, " S"]:
    op = partial(bellman_operator, mdp, pi)
    return loop_until_convergence(op, jnp.zeros(mdp.S), ε)
```

Then, as we showed in @eq-bellman-convergence, by the Banach fixed-point theorem:

$$
\|v^{(t)} - V^\pi \|_{\infty} \le \gamma^{t} \| v^{(0)} - V^\pi\|_{\infty}.
$$

```{python}
iterative_evaluation(tidy_mdp_inf, tidy_policy_messy_only[0])
```

:::: {#rem-iterations-vi}
#### Convergence of iterative policy evaluation

How many iterations do we need for an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate? We
can work backwards to solve for $t$
(note that $\log \gamma < 0$):

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \gamma^t \|v^{(0)} - V^\pi\|_{\infty} &\le \epsilon \\
    t &\ge \frac{\log (\epsilon / \|v^{(0)} - V^\pi\|_{\infty})}{\log \gamma} \\
    &= \frac{\log (\|v^{(0)} - V^\pi\|_{\infty} / \epsilon)}{\log (1 / \gamma)},
\end{aligned}
$$

and so the number of iterations required for an
$\epsilon$-accurate estimate is

$$
T = O\left( \frac{1}{1-\gamma} \log\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon (1-\gamma)}\right) \right).
$$

Note that we've applied the inequalities
$\|v^{(0)} - V^\pi\|_{\infty} \le 1/(1-\gamma)$ and
$\log (1/x) \ge 1-x$.
::::

### Optimality {#sec-infinite-opt}

Now let's move on to solving for an optimal policy in the infinite-horizon case.
As in @def-optimal-policy-finite, an **optimal policy** $\pi^\star$
is one that does at least as well as any other policy in all situations.
That is, for all policies $\pi$,
times $\hi \in \mathbb{N}$,
and initial trajectories
$\tau_{\le \hi} = (s_0, a_0, r_0, \dots, s_\hi)$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    &
    \E_{\tau \sim \rho^{\pi^{\star}}}[
        r_\hi + \gamma r_{\hi+1} + \gamma^2 r_{\hi+2} + \cdots \mid \tau_{\le \hi}] \\
    \ge{}
    &
    \E_{\tau \sim \rho^{\pi}}[
        r_\hi + \gamma r_{\hi+1} + \gamma^2 r_{\hi+2} + \cdots \mid \tau_{\le \hi}]
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-optimal-policy-infinite}

Once again, all optimal policies share the same **optimal value function** $V^\star$,
and the greedy policy with respect to this value function is optimal.

::: {#exr-optimal-greedy}
#### The greedy optimal policy

Verify this by modifying the proof @thm-optimal-greedy from the finite-horizon case.
:::

So how can we compute such an optimal policy?
We can't use the backwards
DP approach from the finite-horizon case @fig-optimal-policy
since there's no "final timestep" to start from.
Instead, we'll exploit the fact that the Bellman consistency
equation @eq-consistency-infinite for the optimal value
function doesn't depend on any policy:

$$
V^\star(s) = \max_a \left[ r(s, a) + \gamma \E_{s' \sim P(s, a)} V^\star(s'). \right]
$$ {#eq-bellman-opt}

As before,
thinking of the r.h.s. of @eq-bellman-opt as an operator on value functions
gives the **Bellman optimality operator**

$$
[\mathcal{J}^{\star}(v)](s) = \max_a \left[ r(s, a) + \gamma \E_{s' \sim P(s, a)} v(s') \right]
$$ {#eq-bellman-opt-operator}

```{python}
def bellman_optimality_operator(mdp: MDP, v: Float[Array, " S"]) -> Float[Array, " S"]:
    return jnp.max(mdp.r + mdp.gamma * mdp.P @ v, axis=1)


def check_optimal(v: Float[Array, " S"], mdp: MDP):
    return jnp.allclose(v, bellman_optimality_operator(v, mdp))
```

#### Value iteration {#sec-vi}

Since the optimal policy is still a policy,
our result that the Bellman
operator is a contracting map still holds,
and so we can repeatedly apply this operator to converge to the optimal value function!
This algorithm is known as **value iteration**.

```{python}
def value_iteration(mdp: MDP, ε: float = 1e-6) -> Float[Array, " S"]:
    """Iterate the Bellman optimality operator until convergence."""
    op = partial(bellman_optimality_operator, mdp)
    return loop_until_convergence(op, jnp.zeros(mdp.S), ε)
```

```{python}
value_iteration(tidy_mdp_inf)
```

Note that the runtime analysis
for an $\epsilon$-optimal value function
is exactly the same as @sec-iterative-pe!
This is because value iteration is simply
the special case of applying iterative policy evaluation
to the *optimal* value function.

As the final step of the algorithm, to return an actual policy
$\hat \pi$, we can simply act greedily with respect to the final iteration
$v^{(T)}$ of our above algorithm:

$$
\hat \pi(s) = \arg\max_a \left[ r(s, a) + \gamma \E_{s' \sim P(s, a)} v^{(T)}(s') \right].
$$ {#eq-value-iteration-extract-policy}

We must be careful, though:
the value function of this greedy policy,
$V^{\hat \pi}$, is *not* the same as $v^{(T)}$,
which need not even be a well-defined value function for some policy!

The bound on the policy's quality is actually quite loose:
if $\|v^{(T)} - V^\star\|_{\infty} \le \epsilon$,
then the greedy policy $\hat \pi$ satisfies
$\|V^{\hat \pi} - V^\star\|_{\infty} \le \frac{2\gamma}{1-\gamma} \epsilon$,
which might potentially be very large.

::: {#thm-greedy-worsen}
#### Greedy policy value worsening

$$
\|V^{\hat \pi} - V^\star \|_{\infty} \le \frac{2 \gamma}{1-\gamma} \|v - V^\star\|_{\infty}
$$

where $\hat \pi(s) = \arg\max_a q(s, a)$ is the greedy policy with respect to

$$
q(s, a) = r(s, a) + \E_{s' \sim P(s, a)} v(s').
$$
:::

::: {.proof}
We first have

$$
\begin{aligned}
        V^{\star}(s) - V^{\hat \pi}(s) &= Q^{\star}(s,\pi^\star(s)) - Q^{\hat \pi}(s, \hat \pi(s))\\
        &= [Q^{\star}(s,\pi^\star(s)) - Q^{\star}(s, \hat \pi(s))] + [Q^{\star}(s, \hat \pi(s)) - Q^{\hat \pi}(s, \hat \pi(s))].
\end{aligned}
$$

Let us bound these two quantities separately.

For the first quantity, note that by the definition of $\hat \pi$, we have

$$
q(s, \hat \pi(s)) \ge q(s,\pi^\star(s)).
$$

Let's add $q(s, \hat \pi(s)) - q(s,\pi^\star(s)) \ge 0$ to the first term to get

$$
\begin{aligned}
        Q^{\star}(s,\pi^\star(s)) - Q^{\star}(s, \hat \pi(s)) &\le [Q^{\star}(s,\pi^\star(s))- q(s,\pi^\star(s))] + [q(s, \hat \pi(s)) - Q^{\star}(s, \hat \pi(s))] \\
        &= \gamma \E_{s' \sim P(s, \pi^{\star}(s))} [ V^{\star}(s') - v(s') ] + \gamma \E_{s' \sim P(s, \hat \pi(s))} [ v(s') - V^{\star}(s') ] \\
        &\le 2 \gamma \|v - V^{\star}\|_{\infty}.
\end{aligned}
$$


The second quantity is bounded by

$$
\begin{aligned}
        Q^{\star}(s, \hat \pi(s)) - Q^{\hat \pi}(s, \hat \pi(s))
        &=
        \gamma \E_{s'\sim P(s, \hat \pi(s))}\left[ V^\star(s') - V^{\hat \pi}(s') \right] \\
        & \leq 
        \gamma \|V^{\star} - V^{\hat \pi}\|_\infty
\end{aligned}
$$

and thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
        \|V^\star - V^{\hat \pi}\|_\infty &\le 2 \gamma \|v - V^{\star}\|_{\infty} + \gamma \|V^{\star} - V^{\hat \pi}\|_\infty \\
        \|V^\star - V^{\hat \pi}\|_\infty &\le \frac{2 \gamma \|v - V^{\star}\|_{\infty}}{1-\gamma}.
\end{aligned}
$$
:::

So in order to compensate and achieve $\|V^{\hat \pi} - V^{\star}\| \le \epsilon$, we must have

$$
\|v^{(T)} - V^\star\|_{\infty} \le \frac{1-\gamma}{2 \gamma} \epsilon.
$$

This means, using @rem-iterations-vi, we need to run value iteration for

$$
T = O\left( \frac{1}{1-\gamma} \log\left(\frac{\gamma}{\epsilon (1-\gamma)^2}\right) \right)
$$

iterations to achieve an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate of the optimal value function.


#### Policy iteration {#sec-pi}

Can we mitigate this "greedy worsening"? What if instead of approximating the optimal value function and then acting greedily by it at the very end, we iteratively improve the policy and value function *together*? This is the idea behind **policy iteration**. In each step, we simply set the policy to act greedily with respect to its own value function.

```{python}
def policy_iteration(mdp: MDP, ε=1e-6) -> Float[Array, "S A"]:
    """Iteratively improve the policy and value function."""
    def op(pi):
        return v_to_greedy(mdp, eval_deterministic_infinite(mdp, pi))
    pi_init = jnp.ones((mdp.S, mdp.A)) / mdp.A  # uniform random policy
    return loop_until_convergence(op, pi_init, ε)
```

```{python}
policy_iteration(tidy_mdp_inf)
```

Although PI appears more complex than VI,
we'll use @thm-bellman-contraction to show convergence.
This will give us the same runtime bound as value iteration and iterative policy evaluation
for an $\epsilon$-optimal value function (@rem-iterations-vi),
although in practice, PI often converges in fewer iterations.
Why so?
Intuitively, by iterating through actual policies,
we can "skip over" different functions that represent the same policy,
which value iteration might iterate through.
For a concrete example,
suppose we have an MDP with three states $\mathcal{S} = \{\text A, \text B, \text C\}$.
Compare the two functions below:

```{python}
#| label: tbl-multiple-q-same-policy
#| tbl-cap: "Two action-value functions that result in the same greedy policy"
#| tbl-subcap:
#|   - One Q-function
#|   - Another Q-function
#| layout-ncol: 2

display(Markdown(tabulate(
    {
        r"$s$": ["A", "B", "C"],
        r"$a = 0$": [0.1, 0.8, 0.4],
        r"$a = 1$": [0.2, 0.9, 0.5],
    },
    "keys"
)))

display(Markdown(tabulate(
    {
        r"$s$": ["A", "B", "C"],
        r"$a = 0$": [0.1, 0.8, 0.4],
        r"$a = 1$": [0.3, 1.0, 0.6],
    },
    "keys"
)))
```

These both map to the same greedy policy,
so policy iteration would never iterate through both of these functions,
while value iteration might.

#### Policy Iteration runtime and convergence

We aim to show that the number of iterations required for an
$\epsilon$-accurate estimate of the optimal value function is

$$
T = O\left( \frac{1}{1-\gamma} \log\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon (1-\gamma)}\right) \right).
$$

This bound follows from the contraction property @eq-bellman-convergence:

$$
\|V^{\pi^{t+1}} - V^\star \|_{\infty} \le \gamma \|V^{\pi^{t}} - V^\star \|_{\infty}.
$$

We'll prove that the iterates of PI respect the contraction property by
showing that the policies improve monotonically:

$$
V^{\pi^{t+1}}(s) \ge V^{\pi^{t}}(s).
$$

Then we'll use this to show
$V^{\pi^{t+1}}(s) \ge [\mathcal{J}^{\star}(V^{\pi^{t}})](s)$. Note that

$$
\begin{aligned}
(s) &= \max_a \left[ r(s, a) + \gamma \E_{s' \sim P(s, a)} V^{\pi^{t}}(s') \right] \\
    &= r(s, \pi^{t+1}(s)) + \gamma \E_{s' \sim P(s, \pi^{t+1}(s))} V^{\pi^{t}}(s')
\end{aligned}
$$

Since
$[\mathcal{J}^{\star}(V^{\pi^{t}})](s) \ge V^{\pi^{t}}(s)$,
we then have

$$
\begin{aligned}
    V^{\pi^{t+1}}(s) - V^{\pi^{t}}(s) &\ge V^{\pi^{t+1}}(s) - \mathcal{J}^{\star} (V^{\pi^{t}})(s) \\
    &= \gamma \E_{s' \sim P(s, \pi^{t+1}(s))} \left[V^{\pi^{t+1}}(s') -  V^{\pi^{t}}(s') \right].
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-pi-iter-proof}

But note that the
expression being averaged is the same as the expression on the l.h.s.
with $s$ replaced by $s'$. So we can apply the same inequality
recursively to get

$$
\begin{aligned}
    V^{\pi^{t+1}}(s) - V^{\pi^{t}}(s) &\ge  \gamma \E_{s' \sim P(s, \pi^{t+1}(s))} \left[V^{\pi^{t+1}}(s') -  V^{\pi^{t}}(s') \right] \\
    &\ge \gamma^2 \E_{\substack{s' \sim P(s, \pi^{t+1}(s)) \\ s'' \sim P(s', \pi^{t+1}(s'))}} \left[V^{\pi^{t+1}}(s'') -  V^{\pi^{t}}(s'') \right]\\
    &\ge \cdots
\end{aligned}
$$

which implies that $V^{\pi^{t+1}}(s) \ge V^{\pi^{t}}(s)$
for all $s$ (since the r.h.s. converges to zero). We can then plug this
back into
@eq-pi-iter-proof
to get the desired result:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    V^{\pi^{t+1}}(s) - \mathcal{J}^{\star} (V^{\pi^{t}})(s) &= \gamma \E_{s' \sim P(s, \pi^{t+1}(s))} \left[V^{\pi^{t+1}}(s') -  V^{\pi^{t}}(s') \right] \\
    &\ge 0 \\
    V^{\pi^{t+1}}(s) &\ge [\mathcal{J}^{\star}(V^{\pi^{t}})](s)
\end{aligned}
$$

This means we can now apply the Bellman convergence result @eq-bellman-convergence to get

$$
\|V^{\pi^{t+1}} - V^\star \|_{\infty} \le \|\mathcal{J}^{\star} (V^{\pi^{t}}) - V^{\star}\|_{\infty} \le \gamma \|V^{\pi^{t}} - V^\star \|_{\infty}.
$$

## Summary

-   Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a framework for sequential
    decision making under uncertainty. They consist of a state space
    $\mathcal{S}$, an action space $\mathcal{A}$, an initial state distribution
    $d_0 \in \Delta(\mathcal{S})$, a transition function $P(s' \mid s, a)$, and a
    reward function $r(s, a)$. They can be finite-horizon (ends after
    $H$ timesteps) or infinite-horizon (where rewards scale by
    $\gamma \in (0, 1)$ at each timestep).

-   Our goal is to find a policy $\pi$ that maximizes expected total
    reward. Policies can be **deterministic** or **stochastic**,
    **history-dependent** or **history-independent**, **stationary** or
    **time-dependent**.

-   A policy induces a distribution over **trajectories**.

-   We can evaluate a policy by computing its **value function**
    $V^\pi(s)$, which is the expected total reward starting from state
    $s$ and following policy $\pi$. We can also compute the
    **state-action value function** $Q^\pi(s, a)$, which is the expected
    total reward starting from state $s$, taking action $a$, and then
    following policy $\pi$. In the finite-horizon setting, these also
    depend on the timestep $\hi$.

-   The **Bellman consistency equation** is an equation that the value
    function must satisfy. It can be used to solve for the value
    functions exactly. Thinking of the r.h.s. of this equation as an
    operator on value functions gives the **Bellman operator**.

-   In the finite-horizon setting, we can compute the optimal policy
    using **dynamic programming**.

-   In the infinite-horizon setting, we can compute the optimal policy
    using **value iteration** or **policy iteration**.
